# CAS Phishing Scam

This repo is used for a project in CS242.

The scam is to encourage users to login into the cloned CAS website. Once pressing 'Sign in', users will be taken to 
fooled.html where they are told that the website they justed logged into is not the real CAS and are warned to look out for 
similar scams in the future.

When doing the project, we did not log any credentials because that is illegal.
